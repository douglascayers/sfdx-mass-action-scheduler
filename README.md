## üßê About the Project

#### üó£ Ethos

Mass Action Scheduler is a [free-as-in-speech](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/) and [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) developed passion project of [Doug Ayers](https://douglascayers.com).

#### üí™ Mission

Put the power of [Batch Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_batch.htm) within reach of [declarative configuration](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=extend_click_intro.htm&type=5).

#### üöÄ Value Proposition

Declaratively schedule Process Builder, Flows, Quick Actions, Email Alerts, Workflow Rules, or Apex to process records from Reports, List Views, SOQL, or Apex.

No more waiting for records to be updated or creating clever workarounds to cause records to be updated to cause these actions to fire.

##### Choose source data to process

##### Choose an action to automate

##### Map fields as inputs to selected action

##### Choose how often to automate action

##### Receive near real-time updates on batch job successes and failures

#### üí° Inspiration

This project is inspired by the following IdeaExchange ideas. Please vote them up to increase chances this functionality becomes standard on the Salesforce platform. Thank you!

Inspired by Marie Chandra's idea [Ability to Schedule when Process Builder Triggers](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DjEmAAK).

Inspired by Narender Singh's idea [Ability to schedule flows, workflows and processes in process builder](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000EA71QAG).

## üéà Features

**Declarative** - no code necessary, never write Batch Apex again for queries that can be expressed in a report or list view and actions that can be expressed with a declarative alternative.

**On Platform** - everything happens in Salesforce so no exporting or uploading data necessary.

**Timely** - run actions [manually](https://github.com/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/wiki/On-Demand-Scheduling) or [schedule](https://github.com/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/wiki/Scheduling) hourly, daily, weekly, or any time in between.

**Versatile** - explore the many [data sources](https://github.com/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/wiki/Sources) and [actions](https://github.com/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/wiki/Actions) that can be [scheduled](https://github.com/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/sfdx-mass-action-scheduler/wiki/Scheduling) with Mass Action Scheduler.
